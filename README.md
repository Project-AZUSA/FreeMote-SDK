# FreeMote SDK

Special Emote engines which take Pure(unencrypted) PSB files as input.

We suggest everyone who can or would like to share PSB files release them in *Pure* PSB format, thus we can get over even eliminate the "Version Isolation" set by M2.

FreeMote SDKs provide a way to use Pure PSB on free/research projects.

For more details, see `readme` for different platforms.

## Generate Pure PSB

You can use `EmoteConv` ([FreeMote](https://github.com/Project-AZUSA/FreeMote#emoteconv-freemotetoolsemotepsbconverter)) or `emote_conv` (by @number201724) to convert an encrypted PSB to Pure PSB. `CryptKey`(get from engine lib) is needed for conversion.

To clarify, we suggest Pure PSB ends with "`pure.psb`".
